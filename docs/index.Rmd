# Prerequisites

In order to use the Terraform with Ansible Deploy ("TwA Deploy", or simply "TwA") program, you will need the following three items:

1. A Linux/Unix computer that is capable of supporting both Python 3.5 (or higher) and Golang version 1.11 (or higher).  The computer, of course, must also have internet access.
2. A Google (a.k.a. Gmail) account (this is required in order to use the Google Cloud Platform).
3. A major Credit Card (this is also required in order to use the Google Cloud Platform.  However, users who qualify for the Google Cloud Platform [free trial](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#free-trial) should be able to avoid any actual charges for the duration of Google's free trial.  Nevertheless, Google still requires a credit card even if you qualify for Google's free trial.)


A computer running any recent version of Linux or MacOS should work fine with the TwA program.  Alternately, a computer running either Windows 10 (version  1607 or later) or Windows Server 2019 (any version) should also work fine (since the TwA install program will enable [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) (WSL) for use by Terraform and Ansible).  All examples and screen shots for this tutorial were actually done on a Windows 10 computer running WSL (upon which Ubuntu 18.04 was running).
