# Installing TwA

TwA Deploy includes an automated installation program for all three supported operating systems:

1. Linux
1. Mac
1. Windows

Please refer to the sub-section below to install TwA for your operating system.

## Linux

Check to see if git is installed on your system.  Run:

git --version

The system should display the git version.  For example:

git version 2.17.1

Git is backwards compatible, so any version written in the last few years will work fine for our purposes.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Releases for the release dates for git.

If Git is not installed on your system, please install it using the following command:

apt-get install git-core

You may be asked to confirm the download and installation; simply enter y to confirm. Itâ€™s that simple, Git should be installed and ready to use!

Create a directory for your TwA projects:

mkdir /projects

sudo chmod 777 /projects   (Note: 777 is bad security practice.  TODO: tighten up security.)

Change into the the new projects directory:

cd /projects

and pull the TwA project from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/mlgopher/TwAdeploy.git

Change into the Linux installer folder for TwA:

cd /projects/TwAdeploy/installer/linux

Then run this command to allow the *.sh files to be run:

sudo chmod 777 *   (Note: 777 is bad security practice.  TODO: tighten up security.)

Then run this command to install the latest version of Terraform:

./terraform.sh

Then run this command to install the latest version of Ansible:

./ansible.sh

Change into the main TwA directory:

cd /projects/TwAdeploy/

Then run this command to initialize Terraform:

terraform init

Assuming no errors occurred with the above commands, TwA is now installed on your system.


## MacOS

MacOS is similar enough to Linux that the install instructions for Linux will probably work just fine for Mac.  Please follow the [Linux install instructions](./installing-twa.html#linux) when installing TwA on a Mac, and let us know if you encounter any issues!

## Windows

In order to install TwA a recent version of Micrsoft Windows is required.  Specifically, either of the folllowing:

* Windows 10 (version  1607 or later) 

or 

* Windows Server 2019 (any version)

minimum versions of Windows is required in order to install TwA.

To install TwA, simply download & run TwA-deploy.exe install program from:

https://www.TwAdeploy.org/TwA-deploy.exe

Note, the above [TwA Windows installation program](./TwA-deploy.exe) will require a reboot of your Micrsoft Windows computer in order to complete.  After the install is completed, simply run the following command:

* wsl

to open the WSL environment within Windows.  Within WSL, run the following two commands:

* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get upgrade (Often takes a LONG time for new WSL installs.  Please be patient...)
* sudo apt-get auto-remove

At this point, the setup process will need to continue within the WSL environment.  Please follow the [Linux install instructions](./installing-twa.html#linux) when installing TwA within WSL on Windows.
